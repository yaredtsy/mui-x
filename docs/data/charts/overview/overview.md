# MUI X Charts

<p class="description">A fast and extendable library of react chart components for data visualization.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader", "design": false}}

## Overview

The `@mui/x-charts` is an MIT library for rendering charts relying on [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for data manipulation and SVG for rendering.
And, like other MUI X components, charts are production-ready components that integrate smoothly into your app.

With a high level of customization, MUI X Charts provides three levels of customization layers: **single components** with great defaults, extensive **configuration props**, and **subcomponents** for flexible composition.
Additionally, you can also use all the [MUI System](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/) tools, such as the theme override or the `sx` prop.

## Using the documentation

The MUI X Charts documentation has a slightly different structure than other MUI X components.
Instead of having a long page for each, the pages are divided in two:

1. General description of the built-in features the component provides.
2. A set of examples demonstrating the component with customizations.

## All MUI X Charts components

## Supported features

The features that are shared across multiple Charts components, such as axes and legends, are also documented on separate pages.
